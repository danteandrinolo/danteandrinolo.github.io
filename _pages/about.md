Hi! My name is Dante Andrinolo, I am a PhD Student at University of Southern California, and my interest lies within the intersection between Signal processing, Probability theory, Inverse problems and Applied Mathematics in General. Currently I am fortunate to be working under the advise of Prof. Justin Haldar in MRI reconstruction inverse problems. Previously I got my undergraduate degree in Telecommunications engineering at National University of La Plata, Argentina. There, I was advised by Dr. M. Fernandez-Corazza and Prof. C. Muravchik to complete my thesis related to inverse problems in transcranial electrica stimulation (see portfolio for more details).

Outside academy, I am intersted in coffee, Reading and Calisthenics.
