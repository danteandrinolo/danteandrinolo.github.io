Research experience
======
* July 2024: Research Assistant at PES-LEICI-UNLP
  * National University of La Plata
  * I am currently working in an extended version of my undergraduate thesis work, using a more complex head and electrode models. This work is intended to be submitted for publishing.
  * Advisor: Dr. Mariano Fernández-Corazza and Dr. Carlos H. Muravchik.

* November 2022 - February 2024: Optimized tES for TTFields (Undergraduate thesis)
  * National University of La Plata
  * Worked in Optimal Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) for Tumoral Treating in order to complete my thesis work. I published part of the work in a Conference paper as first author.
  * Advisor: Dr. Mariano Fernández-Corazza and Dr. Carlos H. Muravchik.

* August 2023 - February 2024: Reflectometry Signal Processing for Galileo signals (Capstone project)
  * National University of La Plata
  * Duties included: Worked on a GNSS signal processing project as part of a university cubesat development project. The results achieved in this work were published (first author) in a conference paper. Also, this work was presented at GCURS sessions at Rice University.
  * Advisor: Dr. Santiago Ozafrain.

Work experience
====== 
* September 2023 - December 2023 Supervised Professional Practice
  * INVAP (Remote)
  * I developed an algorithm to maximize the minimum blind velocity in a pulsed radar based on PRF multiple selection.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Martin Hurtado.
