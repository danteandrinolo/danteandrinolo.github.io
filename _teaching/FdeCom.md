I've been TA in "fundamentos de las comunicaciones" at UNLP since 2022. 

In this course are introduced several topics of interest for communications and particularly the signal processing point of view for analog and digital communications.

Topics
======
Correlation and its relation with convolution. Spectral power/energy density. Noise modelling: Johnson and Shot. Linear and exponential modulation. Random Signals. Hilbert Transform. Heterodyne receptors. Phase Locked Loop. Introduction to digital communications (Binary case). Quantization noise.

My role
======
For this course, I've been grading laboratory reports and tests, Given some Lectures, answered student questions in class,  and I've written a introduction to Stochastic processes as at the moment there is a gap between this course and a formal stochastic processes course.
