Abstract—Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are
designed to provide precise positioning, velocity, and timing information
through satellite constellations. These satellites transmit
signals to GNSS receivers to determine location parameters.
Beyond their traditional use, GNSS signals reflected, refracted,
and scattered by the Earth’s surface and atmosphere have been
utilized in remote sensing applications, leading to techniques
like GNSS Reflectometry (GNSS-R) and GNSS Radio Occultation
(GNSS-RO). GNSS-R involves processing signals reflected
from the Earth’s surface to extract geophysical parameters,
employing GNSS-R receivers located on ground stations, airborne
platforms, or Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. The Cyclone
Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission, led by the
University of Michigan and sponsored by NASA, utilizes GPS-R
to capture reflections of GPS L1 C/A signals. In this work we
use CYGNSS public data to generate a Galileo-R event dataset,
focusing on reflections from the ocean and the Amazon Basin.
We processed raw intermediate frequency (IF) data to obtain
Delay-Doppler Maps (DDMs) from Galileo signals, calculated
relevant parameters, and created a public dataset for Galileo-R
Ocean and Amazon basin events. This paper details the signal
processing methodology, dataset characteristics, and a statistical
analysis of the classified events.
